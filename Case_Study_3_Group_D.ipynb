Penjualan cenderung tinggi pada bulan ke-7. Namun pada hari senin, terlihat bahwa terjadi peningkatan penjualan pada bulan ke-9 padahal sebelumnya tidak terdapat transaksi pada bulan ke-8 pada hari Senin, Hal ini juga terjadi pada hari Minggu bulan ke-10 dan hari Selasa bulan ke-8. Hal ini perlu diselidiki lebih lanjut oleh perusahaan mengapa hal ini dapat terjadi, mungkin bisa dikarenakan stok barang yang habis ataupun kurangnya promosi dari perusahaan. Agar penjualan dapat stabil tiap bulannya, perusahaan dapat membuat penawaran/promo yang menarik tiap bulannya untuk menarik minat konsumen, selain itu ketersediaan stok barang juga perlu diperhatikan."

Di samping itu, Clean memiliki support yang besar yang mana artinya produk tersebut lebih sering dibeli daripada Luks. Lalu, Luks memiliki support yang cenderung lebih kecil kecil atau dengan kata lain Luks lebih jarang dibeli dibandingkan Clean. Karena Luks dan Clean memiliki jenis yang sama yaitu alat untuk mandi, maka dapat disarankan agar meletakkan Luks dan Clean berdekatan (dalam 1 section) agar ketika customer membeli Clean (Shampoo), mereka juga teringat untuk membeli Luks (Sabun). Selain itu, dapat dilihat pula apabila Clean dan Liftboy memiliki lift lebih dari 1 namun cenderung tidak terlalu besar. Dengan demikian, Liftboy juga dapat diletakkan berdekatan dengan Clean, yaitu termasuk ke dalam section alat mandi."
